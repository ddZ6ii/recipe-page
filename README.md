### What I learned

Image optimization ðŸš€

The following piece of code provides a pool of image candidates (`srcset` attribute) for the browser to automatically pick from, based on screen characteristics (width, DPR, orientation and zoom level) and provided hints (`sizes` attribute):

```html
<img
  sizes="(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"
  srcset="
    assets/images/omelette-recipe-320.jpg   320w,
    assets/images/omelette-recipe-640.jpg   640w,
    assets/images/omelette-recipe-960.jpg   960w,
    assets/images/omelette-recipe-1280.jpg 1280w
  "
  src="assets/images/omelette-recipe-1280.jpg"
  alt="omelette dish"
  width="1280"
  height="585"
  class="sm:rounded-xl"
/>
```

The following piece of code provides a pool of image candidates with modern alternative format (`.webp`) for the browser to use in priority, or to fallback to the `.jpg` format if not supported:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    type="image/webp"
    sizes="(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"
    srcset="
      assets/images/omelette-recipe-320.webp   320w,
      assets/images/omelette-recipe-640.webp   640w,
      assets/images/omelette-recipe-960.webp   960w,
      assets/images/omelette-recipe-1280.webp 1280w
    "
  />
  <img
    sizes="..."
    srcset="..."
    src="assets/images/omelette-recipe-1280.jpg"
    alt="omelette dish"
    width="1280"
    height="585"
    class="sm:rounded-xl"
  />
</picture>
```
